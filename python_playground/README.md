# Python Playground

This small script reproduces the menu-building algorithm used in the
ASP.NET Core app. It lets you experiment with the category tree and
sample publications entirely in Python.

Run it from the package root:

```bash
python -m python_playground
```

You can also run the simplified playground directly:

```bash
python menu_playground.py
```

Both commands will print a simple text-based tree of categories and the
published posts associated with each category.
