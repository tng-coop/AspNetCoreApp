# Python Playground

This small script reproduces the menu-building algorithm used in the
ASP.NET Core app. It lets you experiment with the category tree and
sample publications entirely in Python.

Run it with:

```bash
python menu_playground.py
```

It will print out a simple text-based tree of categories and the
published posts associated with each category.
